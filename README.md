# Archery Age Division Calculator
Simple calculator for NFAA and USA Archery age divisions based on birthdate and date of competition

## Instructions
Please consult the `demo-form.html` file for a basic example of building a form that uses
the date calculations in the `js/alculate-age-divisons.js` file. You'll need to make sure to
assign the appropriate `id` fields so the script will be able to insert the proper values
into the output table.

The HTML is basic with no frills. You can dress it up however you like as long as you
maintain the `id`s that the script is expecting.

## Requirements
This script relies on the third-party `Moment.js` library to do its date calculations. You
can see how to import that library in the `demo-form.html` file near the top in the `<head>`
section.

The script is provided for free. Please consider giving credit to Tim Wilson and linking

useful archery-related software. A link to the [Minnesota Archers Alliance (MAA)](https://themnaa.org/) 
would also be appreciated.
